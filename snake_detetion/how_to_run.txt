### Instructions for Setting Up Fire Detection Environment

1. Create Conda Environment:
    ```
    conda create --name snake_detection python=3.10
    ```

2. Activate Conda Environment:
    ```
    conda activate snake_detection
    ```

3. Install Dependencies:
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    Ensure you are in the environment you created (snake_detection) before running this command.
    ```

4. Run Fire Detection Script:
    ```
    python snake_detector.py
    ```
    This command will execute the fire detection script, utilizing the dataset and the installed dependencies.
